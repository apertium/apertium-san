Morphological analyser for Sanskrit
===================================

==Installation==

To compile it you need lttoolbox installed:

$ lt-comp lr apertium-sa-XX.sa.dix sa.automorf.bin

To use it:

$ echo "rAjA" | lt-proc -c sa.automorf.bin 

You should get the output:

^rAjA/rAj<n><m><3><sg>/rAjan<n><m><1><sg>$

Note: the -c option is important to respect case.

If you want to install it and have it to work
with apertium deformatters etc. you will need to have
apertium installed.

Just run:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

==Encoding==

The dictionary is in ASCII and uses the wx-notation.
